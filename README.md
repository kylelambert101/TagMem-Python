# TagMem
I wrote the TagMem program to keep track of tidbits of info I knew I wouldn't remember.  Since I wrote it for myself, some of the code is kind of fast-and-loose.  Maybe I'll clean it up with comments one day. 

Note: TagMem works with a python data file named myMemory.dat - if the file does not exist, the program will create one in the working directory. I don't include one in this repository because the file holds all of my "remembered" information, and it's obviously better to keep that on my computer.
